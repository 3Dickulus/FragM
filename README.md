#### We need the latest version of GLM

      wget https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archive/primary/+files/libglm-dev_0.9.9.3-2_all.deb
      sudo dpkg -i libglm-dev_0.9.9.3-2_all.deb

## Get the source...

    git clone https://github.com/3Dickulus/FragM.git FragM
      
    or download and extract the .zip or .tar.gz source archive from https://github.com/3Dickulus/FragM/releases/

## Build and install

      cd FragM/Fragmentarium-Source
      mkdir build
      cd build
      cmake -DUSE_OPEN_EXR=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/ ..
      make install

    The above will install in /home/username/Fragmentarium folder with includes and support files.

    To install for all users change -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/ to -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local and use sudo make install

   Depends:     Qt5Core, Qt5Gui, Qt5OpenGL, Qt5Script, Qt5Widgets, Qt5Xml

# Guidelines for contributing
    1. any new feature must work on the widest range of hardware, ( AMD Intel and nVidia ) all if possible
    2. any changes to existing features must be compatible with the existing fragment base
    3. existing features that only work on specific hardware should be phased out or modified to work on all hardware.
    4. when adding options or settings they must be in line with the existing structure for handling options and settings
       (unless you have a better idea that makes the current structure obsolete)
    5. priority should go towards handling more modern GLSL versions and practices
    6. changes and additions must be tested against all other features, animating, timeline management,
       easing curve controls etc... and render the base frags properly before merging will be considered.

...of course none of this is carved in stone and I'm always open for discussing ideas.

## Notes

The deb and rpm packages should take care of any dependencies when installing via **apt / synaptic** or **yast / zypper**.

The Windows .7z file is an archive with everything FragM needs to run, includes all of the required Qt and runtime DLLs, this can be extracted and placed anywhere.

The best version will be the one you compile yourself because it will be optimized for your hardware setup.

And finally, please see the FAQ http://blog.hvidtfeldts.net/index.php/2011/12/fragmentarium-faq/ and https://fractalforums.org/fragmentarium/17 if you have any problems.

If you don't find an answer to your problem/question you can post on the Fragmentarium board at FractalForums.org or raise an issue here on github in the FragM repo.
