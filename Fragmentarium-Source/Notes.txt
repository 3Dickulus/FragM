Version 2.0.b ("beta"). 

Fragmentarium is a cross-platform application for exploring pixel based graphics on the GPU.

Originally created by Mikael Hvidtfeldt Christensen.

It is similar to Adobe's Pixel Bender, but uses pure GLSL.

Features:
* Multi-tabbed IDE, with GLSL syntax highlighting
* User widgets to manipulate parameter settings.
* Different 'mouse to GLSL' mapping schemes
* Modular GLSL programming - include other fragments
* Includes simple raytracer for distance estimated systems
* Many examples including Mandelbulb, Mandelbox, Kaleidoscopic IFS, and Julia Quaternion.

Acknowledgement

Much of the inspiration and formulas for Fragmentarium came from the community at FractalForums.com, including Tom Beddard, Jan Kadlec, IÃ±igo Quilez, Buddhi, Jesse, and others. Special thanks goes out to Knighty and Kali for their great fragments and claude for all the help with improvements. All fragments should include information about their origins - please notify me, if I made any mis-attributions.

The icons used are part of the Everaldo: Crystal project. 

Fragmentarium is built using the Qt cross-platform GUI framework.
